  <h1> Current and Recent Interests </h1>
  <h2> Literary Gaming </h2>
  <p> I am very interested in implementing a curricula that incorporates video games as a form of literature, as opposed to or supplementary to written works of literature.</p>
<h3> Gaming as a Profession </h3>
  <p> I am very much interested in talking about, and researching, having the time to play and research video games. They can often take longer than most novels, not only because the stories can be long, but there are also varying levels of skill and strategy needed to be able to continue through the game and reach the end. </p>
